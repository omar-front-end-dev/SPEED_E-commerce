Compression ratio is up to 13.6:1 alongside revised ports, valve timing and springs. The crankshaft and titanium conrods are lighter, reducing spinning inertia. And every gear ratio is shorter, boosting acceleration with the throttle precision that 2 Motor TBW ensures. The numbers are impressive. 160kW / 215hp @14,000rpm and 113Nm @12,000rpm. But it's the way this engine now drives relentlessly – yet so smoothly, controllably – through the mid-range all the way to the redline, with such an increase in fighting power, that's so exhilarating.",

      "description": "The dark and muscular 2023 Suzuki M109R B.O.S.S. continues to be the performance cruiser other bikes wish they were. This M109R has a powerful V-twin engine with some of the largest pistons in the industry - a bike that will get your adrenaline flowing whenever you ride. This 109 cubic inch engine is wrapped with aggressive blacked-out styling that includes slash-cut mufflers, drag-style bars, a supplied solo seat cowl, and a distinctively shaped headlight nacelle that's uniquely Suzuki. The deep red and black or bright blue and black paint schemes are so visually stunning that the M109R draws attention away from everything else on the road. This bike is not just about looks, as stout inverted forks, a hidden single-shock rear suspension, and an ideally designed saddle deliver responsive handling and an exceptionally comfortable ride. Hold on as performance never looked so good, or so dark.",
